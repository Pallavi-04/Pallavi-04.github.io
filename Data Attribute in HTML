USING DATA ATTRIBUTES-------------------
HTML is designed with extensibility in mind for data that should be associated with a particular element
but need not have any defined meaning. data-* attributes allow us to store extra information on 
standard, semantic HTML elements without other hacks such as non-standard attributes, or extra properties on DOM.

Any attribute on any element whose attribute name starts with data- is a data attribute.

from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device
